Ideas for data visualization

* How many words do the top characters speak, is there a difference by gender? 
* Does this change over seasons? 
* Per episode, how is the number of words spoken by female characters associated with rating?

First, subset to top 10 characters that speak the most words on the entire show. And add gender.

```{r find-top10-add-gender}

#Choose top 10 characters with most words
#Dialogue is 'tokenized'- each line is a word
top10_chars <- dialogue %>% 
  tabyl(character) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  pull(character)

#Set gender for each character
top10_gender <- c("m", "m", "m", "f", "m", "f", "m", "f", "m", "m")
top10_gender
 
#Make KEY for character and gender
top10_chars <- as_tibble(top10_chars) %>% 
  cbind(top10_gender) %>% 
    rename("character" = value, 
           "gender" = top10_gender) %>% 
  mutate(gender = case_when(
    gender == "m" ~ "Male", 
    TRUE ~ "Female"))

top10_chars

#Filter words to top 10 characters, and join gender to dataset
dialogue_top10 <- dialogue %>% 
  filter(character %in% top10_chars$character) %>% 
  left_join(top10_chars)

unique(dialogue_top10$character)
dialogue_top10
  
```

Next, join in ratings and season date

```{r join-ratings}
office_ratings
str(office_ratings)

str(dialogue_top10)

dialogue_top10 <- dialogue_top10 %>% 
  mutate(season = as.numeric(season), 
         episode = as.numeric(episode)) %>% 
  left_join(office_ratings, 
            by = c("season", "episode"))

dialogue_top10

```


Now, sum words by character and by episode

```{r sum-words}

```
